Package: BayesTools
Title: Tools for Bayesian Analyses
Version: 0.0.0.9003
Description: Provides tools for conducting Bayesian analyses. The package contains 
    functions for creating a wide range of prior distribution objects, mixing posterior 
    samples from JAGS and Stan models, plotting posterior distributions, and etc...
    The tools for working with prior distribution span from visualization, generating JAGS 
    and bridgesampling syntax to basic functions such as rng, quantile, and distribution functions. 
    creating samples, computing quantiles.

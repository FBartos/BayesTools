## to be version 0.1.2
### Fixes
- `prior.plot` can't plot "spike" with `plot_type == "ggplot"` (Issue #6)
- `MCMC error/SD` print names in BayesTools tables (Issue #8)

### Features
- `interpret` function for creating textual summaries based on inference and samples objects

## version 0.1.1
### Fixes
- `plot_posterior` fails with only mu & PET samples (Issue #5)
- ordering by "probabilities" does not work in 'plot_models' (Issue #3)
- BF goes to NaN when only a single model is present in 'models_inference' (Issue #2)
- summary tables unit tests unable to deal with numerical precision
- problems with aggregating samples across multiple spikes in `plot_posterior'

### Features
- allow density.prior with range lower == upper  (Issue #4)
- moving rstan towards suggested packages
